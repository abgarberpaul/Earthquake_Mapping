earthquake mapping with geojson

**Level One (complete):**

All files to run the functioning Level One page are stored in Leaflet-Step-1 folder: 

    - index.html
    
    - See css folder for style.css
    
    - See js folder for config.js (main code)

__Required Elements, level one:__

1. Call the [USGS GeoJSON Feed](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) 

2. Create a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquate data

3. Data markers should reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and and depth of the earth quake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in color.

4. Include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.

5. Create a legend that will provide context for your map data.

**Level Two (complete)**

All files to run the functioning Level Two page are stored in Leaflet-Step-2 folder: 
    
    - index.html 
    
    - See css folder for style.css
    
    - See js folder for config.js (main code)
    
    - Js folder also contains choropleth.js file

__Required Elements, level two:__

1. Call the source for tectonic plate coordinates in GeoJSON

2. Create a choropleth layer with tectonic plate data

3. Create responsive layer for adding or removing both tectonic plate data and earthquake data

4. Create responsive optional base layers for viewing map (three demonstrated- standard, gray and satellite)
